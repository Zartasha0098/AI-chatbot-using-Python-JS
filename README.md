# AI-chatbot-using-Python-JS
Building an AI chatbot using Python and JavaScript involves creating a system where users can interact with a bot that processes their inputs and provides relevant responses. This can be done using a combination of Python for the backend and machine learning logic, and JavaScript for the frontend user interface
# AI Chatbot

This project is an AI chatbot built using Python for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend. The chatbot can understand user inputs and provide relevant responses using basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project is structured to allow easy enhancement with more advanced machine learning models in the future.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: Users can interact with the chatbot through a simple web-based interface.
- **Basic NLP**: The chatbot uses rule-based NLP to generate responses.
- **Extensible Design**: The backend is designed to be easily extendable with more sophisticated NLP and machine learning models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm (for serving the frontend, optional)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Basic knowledge of Python and Flask

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-chatbot.git
    cd ai-chatbot
    ```

2. **Set Up the Backend**:
    - Create a virtual environment:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
      ```
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install flask flask-cors
      ```

3. **Set Up the Frontend** (Optional):
    If you want to use a local server to serve the frontend, you can use a tool like `http-server` (you need Node.js and npm installed):
    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Serve the Frontend** (Optional):
    If using `http-server`, navigate to the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    http-server
    ```
    Then, open your browser and go to the URL provided by `http-server` (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).

3. **Open the Frontend**:
    Open `index.html` directly in a web browser if not using a local server.
